picimo is a [creative coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding) project containing several javascript &or; typescript libraries &and; demos loosely based on realtime 2.5d graphics in html5 with webgl.

in the creation of picimo there were the following main objectives:

- I do wanna create realtime animated graphics in webgl and makes it easy to develop special effects in webdev or even gamedev in desktop and mobile browsers
- I want to create [sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics))<sup>*</sup> with custom properties defined by me and my imagination and render them with my own custom webgl shaders &mdash; and the API should be as simple as possible and be fun to use!<sup>**</sup>
- it should be easy to display [pixel art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art) graphics in a [responsive design aware environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)

_<sup>*</sup> **Why sprites?** &hellip; as a child of the eighties i grew up with computers and console games that didn't have special 3d hardware. at that time most games consisted of 2d-sprites, 2d-levels with parallax effects and sprites that simulated a 3d environment (also known as 2.5d) - already at that time I wanted to be able to program something like that, but somehow I was kept from &hellip;_<sup>***</sup>

_<sup>**</sup> the most important aspect of all :wink:_

_<sup>***</sup> I am glad you ask: you can [hire me as a freelance front-end developer](https://www.spearwolf.de) &mdash; I am always happy to receive exciting project requests!_

so picimo was started as a part time project in my spare time &mdash; during the evolutionary development phases the following experiences and insights were gained:

- when developing your own webgl based rendering engine you can learn a lot of things but in the long run it is quite costly &mdash; so, why trying to reinvet the wheel? it is for this reason picimo relies on the fantastic [three.js](https://threejs.org/) as webgl renderer
  
  picimo does not even try to hide the three.js api, but sees itself as an additional library which has that one feature, a complicated thing intentionally made simple! &hellip; yep, you guessed it: sprite rendering and all the things that go with it
  
- the development of visual and interactive applications using imperative programming is annoying &mdash; this is nothing new and is probably also responsible for the success of [react](https://reactjs.org/) (or similar frameworks). after early first experiments with a json based scene description or a web component based approach (how it does [a-frame](https://aframe.io/)), picimo now uses the declarative, component based approach of the young and incredibly exciting project [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber)

this is the main github repository for the picimo project and all of its related sub-projects.

the repository is organized into sub-directories containing the various projects. Check out the README.md files for specific projects to get more details:

| sub-directory | what's inside? |
|---------------|----------------|
| [picimo](packages/picimo/) | the main library |
| [picimo&#8209;r3f](packages/picimo-r3f/) | react components based on react-three-fiber (highly promising but also very experimental) |
| [kitchen&#8209;sink](packages/kitchen-sink/) | a [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) with code examples for almost all features of the picimo library (is subject to major changes &mdash; in future all examples will be moved successively to the [`examples/*`](examples/) directory |
| [examples/**/*](examples/) | picimo examples &mdash; good starting point to learn about how to use the picimo api |
| [picimo&#8209;demo&#8209;shell](packages/picimo-demo-shell/) | a cli wrapper for webpack config and launcher to speed up development of the picimo code examples |
| [datgui&#8209;context&#8209;hook](packages/datgui-context-hook/) | react hook for the [dat.gui](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) library |

## Development

When developing across all the projects in this repository, first install [git](https://git-scm.com/), [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).

Then, perform the following steps to get set up for development:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:spearwolf/picimo.git
cd picimo
yarn
yarn build
yarn test
```

You should now be ready to work on any of the picimo projects :rocket:

Since this a monorep, we have global *babel*, *eslint* and *prettier* configs. Try these scripts:

| script | description |
|--------|-------------|
| `yarn lint` | Run `eslint` and `prettier` checks for all sources across all workspaces |
| `yarn fix` | Run `eslint` and `prettier` *fixes* for all sources across all workspaces |
| `yarn cbt` | Run in sequence: `clean` &rarr; `build` &rarr; `test` across all workspaces |
